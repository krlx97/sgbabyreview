  Do you share the same frustration as us when it comes to choosing baby-related
  products or services because you want the best for your child?

  We created this site to fulfill the need for a local platform that gathers
  personal, unbiased reviews from the community. On SGbabyreview, you will find
  trusted reviews written by fellow parents in Singapore. It is also a space for
  you to share your own experiences and advice about using a product or service.
  Through a supportive community, we hope that you can make more informed
  decisions about the care of your child!
